RFM Customer Segmentation Model

This project implements an RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior. RFM is a widely used technique in customer analytics, marketing strategy, and CRM systems to identify high-value customers and support data-driven business decisions.

The project processes transactional data to compute RFM metrics, score customers accordingly, and assign them to meaningful behavioral segments. The implementation is designed to be clear, reproducible, and easily extensible for real-world business applications.

Technical Overview

Recency: Time since the customer’s most recent purchase

Frequency: Number of transactions within a defined period

Monetary: Total or average spend per customer

Customers are ranked and scored based on these dimensions to create interpretable segments such as high-value, loyal, at-risk, or inactive customers.

Why This Project Is Relevant

RFM modeling is commonly used in e-commerce, retail analytics, marketing automation, and customer retention systems. This project demonstrates the ability to:

Transform raw transaction data into actionable features

Apply analytical models aligned with business objectives

Interpret customer segments and support strategic decision-making

Bridge technical analysis with real-world business use cases

These skills are directly applicable to data scientist, ML engineer, and business analytics roles.
